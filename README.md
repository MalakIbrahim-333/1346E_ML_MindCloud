## Task 1: Diabetes Prediction

In this task, I worked on building a machine learning model to predict diabetes using patient medical and demographic data. The dataset included features such as gender, age, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

**Work performed:**

- Focused on implementing a **Diabetes Predicition** model:
  - Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Pandas and Matplotlib.
  - Performed **data preprocessing**, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  - Selected relevant features for modeling based on correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
  - Trained the model on the training data and evaluated it on the test set.
  - Calculated **F1 score** and visualized performance using a **confusion matrix**.
  - Compiled results and observations into a PDF report.

> **Note:** Creating three separate folders (`Logistic Regression`, `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`) under `Task1_Diabetes_Classify` was not performed; all work was done within the same jupyter notebook.

## Task 2: Research Skills

The research component focused on understanding core machine learning concepts and evaluation methods.

**Work performed:**

- Prepared 2-page PDF documents for each topic:
  - **Gradient Descent:** Concept and applications in machine learning.
  - **ROC Curve:** Interpretation and usage in model evaluation.
  - **KNN Algorithm:** Overview and applications in classification tasks.

This work demonstrates hands-on application of machine learning, from data analysis and preprocessing to model training and evaluation, supported by research to reinforce understanding of key AI concepts.
